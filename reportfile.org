* Risk Analysis
** Drawdown Analysis
The strategy shows varying levels of drawdown across timeframes:
- Shortest timeframe (5D) :: Lowest drawdown at 10.15%
- Medium timeframes (1M-6M) :: Moderate drawdowns between 26-30%
- Longer timeframes (1Y-5Y) :: Significant drawdowns up to 87.36%

** Risk-Adjusted Returns
- Best risk-adjusted performance in 6-month timeframe (Profit Factor: 1.318)
- Poorest risk-adjusted performance in 1-year timeframe (Profit Factor: 0.775)
- Most consistent profitability in medium timeframes (1M-6M)

* Strategy Assessment
** Strengths
1. High win rate across most timeframes (60-71%)
2. Strong performance in medium-term trades (1M-6M)
3. Significant potential for long-term gains (90.25% in 5Y)

** Weaknesses
1. High maximum drawdown in longer timeframes
2. Inconsistent performance across different periods
3. Poor performance in 1-year timeframe

* Recommendations
1. Consider position sizing adjustments to reduce maximum drawdown
2. Implement stop-loss mechanisms for better risk management
3. Focus optimization on medium-term timeframes where strategy shows best consistency
4. Consider adding filters for volatile market conditions

* Conclusion
The mean reversion strategy shows promise with strong performance in medium timeframes but requires careful risk management for longer-term trading. The strategy performs best in 3-6 month periods, suggesting optimal use in these timeframes.

* Current Status
The trading bot is currently:
- Deployed :: Online on AWS EC2
- Operational Status :: Signal generation active
- Execution Status :: Long signals failing due to insufficient capital
* Technical Implementation
** Code Architecture
*** Core Components
- Authentication System
  - HMAC-SHA256 signature generation for API security
  - Environment variable management for credentials
  - Real-time API interaction with Pi42 exchange

- Data Management
  - Real-time price fetching at 1-minute intervals
  - Rolling window of 24 data points for analysis
  - Pandas DataFrame implementation for efficient data handling

- Trading Logic
  - Mean reversion based on standard deviation bands
  - Signal generation using 24-period rolling calculations
  - Position tracking and risk management system

*** Key Functions
**** generate_signature
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def generate_signature(api_secret, data_to_sign):
    return hmac.new(
        api_secret.encode("utf-8"),
        data_to_sign.encode("utf-8"),
        hashlib.sha256,
    ).hexdigest()
#+END_SRC

**** calculate_metrics
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def calculate_metrics(self, close):
    rolling_window = 24
    # ... calculation of mean and standard deviation
    mean = self.historical_data["close"].rolling(window=rolling_window).mean()
    std = self.historical_data["close"].rolling(window=rolling_window).std()
#+END_SRC

**** mean_reversion_strategy
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def mean_reversion_strategy(self, close, metrics, date, risk):
    if close < metrics["mean"] - metrics["std"]:
        sign = "buy"
    elif close > metrics["mean"] + metrics["std"]:
        sign = "sell"  # Note: Not executed in practice
    else:
        sign = "buy"
#+END_SRC

** Data Flow
1. Real-time data fetching (1-minute intervals)
2. Statistical calculations using 24-period window
3. Signal generation based on mean reversion
4. Trade execution and position management
5. Comprehensive logging and reporting

** Implementation Notes
- Although kurtosis and skewness are calculated, they are not used in trading decisions.
  - was reason difficult for me to test in real time.
- Focus on mean reversion for increased signal generation
- Only long positions are executed despite dual-sided signals
- AWS EC2 deployment for continuous operation
- Comprehensive logging system for post-trade analysis
